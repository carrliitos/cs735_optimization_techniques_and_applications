    Symbol declared but no values have been assigned. Check for missing
       data definition, assignment, data loading or implicit assignment
       via a solve statement. Suppress with $onImplicitAssign.
       A wild shot: You may have spurious commas in the explanatory
       text of a declaration. Check symbol reference list.
